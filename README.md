# Qt-HelloWorld
HelloWorld using Qt Creator

Basic app using QtQuick and QtQuick controls, part of Qt5.

To build this app you will need Qt5 and qmake installed.

1. cd HelloWorld
2. qmake
3. make

For systems with both qt4 and qt5 installed, you may need to use qmake-qt5 instead (varies according to OS).
This project should also be importable into QtCreator for build&run using the graphical utilies.
